          I am a dedicated software developer with over 1 year of experience,
          specializing in building cross-platform mobile applications using
          JavaScript, TypeScript, and React Native CLI. I have developed and
          maintained dynamic apps for both Android and iOS, with a focus on
          performance, scalability, and user-centric design. Beyond frontend
          development, I also build robust backends using FastAPI (Python) and
          Node.js, integrating RESTful APIs with MySQL and MongoDB. My
          full-stack project experience includes a Zepto-style grocery delivery
          app, a role-based user management system, and a rare disease
          dictionary app. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems
          through code, optimizing user experience, and scaling multi-role
          environments such as seller, delivery, and admin dashboards.

          Welcome to my portfolio! I specialize in crafting modern, responsive
          mobile and web applications with clean, maintainable code and a strong

          Native, and Flutter, I build seamless, cross-platform apps for both
          Android and iOS. On the backend, I develop scalable APIs using FastAPI
          (Python) and Node.js, integrating with databases like MySQL and
          MongoDB. Explore my projects to see how I approach frontend and
          backend development, problem-solving, and UI/UX design. If you're
