  I am a dedicated software developer with over 1 year of experience,
  specializing in building cross-platform mobile applications using
  JavaScript, TypeScript, React Native CLI, and Flutter. I have developed and
  maintained dynamic apps for both Android and iOS, focusing on performance,
  scalability, and user-centric design. On the backend, I work with FastAPI
  (Python), Node.js, and Django, integrating RESTful APIs with MySQL and
  MongoDB. My project experience includes a grocery delivery app (Flutter + Node.js + MongoDB),
  a role-based user management system (FastAPI + MySQL), a rare disease dictionary app
  (React Native frontend only), and a chat app called Fridsphere built with Django.
  I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through code, enhancing user experience,
  and building scalable systems for multi-role environments like seller, delivery,
  and admin dashboards.
